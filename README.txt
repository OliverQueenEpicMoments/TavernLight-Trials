Yeah so like after 3 grueling days of failing and trying really hard, I did in fact get the server and client to work and I was able to log in and play the game. But I'm gonna be completely honest with you, I have no idea how to even begin to implement the features for trials 5, 6 and 7. I understand if you want to go ahead and not hire me but let it be known I did put in the effort to get the server and client up and did the other trials, so I'm still very willing to learn with a helping hand.
